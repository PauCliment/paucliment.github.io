## Autonomous racing vehicle for the 2023 season

Introducing the 2023 UPC ecoRacing Formula Student car. As the head of the driverless department, I'm thrilled to highlight our notable advancements, the wollowing of which I played a key role in:
- Enhanced sensor and camera suite for robust performance
- Upgraded stable lateral control system
- Implementation of Neuronal PID for optimized speed control
