## Autonomous racing vehicle for the 2023 season

This is the new formula student car for the 2023 season by UPC ecoRacing. As the chief of the driverless department, I am especially proud to share some of the advancements we have made in which I was specially involved
* Robust sensor and camera suite
* Improved stable lateral control
* Neuronal PID for optimal speed control

### New vehicle
This vehicle marks the team's 15th year building racecars, which was deserving of a special livery.

### Camera module
This season, I was in charge of designing the new camera module, for which an organic design seemed adequate for better aerodynamics and tighter component placing, leveraging 3D printing technologies.

### Control improvements
One of the main improvements I made was to include a stability criterion to the car, which allows it to drive at the limit. Also, a new adaptive neuronal PID controller allows for an optimal speed control.
