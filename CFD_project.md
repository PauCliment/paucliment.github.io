## Ground Effect vehicle CFD analysis
A friend and I collaborated on the analysis of a fascinating vehicle that utilizes the ground effect and two tandem wings to achieve faster speeds on the water's surface with greater efficiency than a boat or plane. To conduct our analysis, we utilized OpenFOAM for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
