## Ground Effect vehicle CFD analysis
<div style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
A friend and I collaborated on the analysis of a fascinating vehicle that utilizes the ground effect and two tandem wings to achieve faster speeds on the water's surface with greater efficiency than a boat or plane. To conduct our analysis, we utilized OpenFOAM for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We were able to observe the interactions between the ground and the flow field around the wings.
